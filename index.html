        <h2> 1. Find a Place to Stay</h2>
        <p>If your friends are anything like mine, it's as easy as hearding cats.
        <br>Renting a house, versus a hotel makes the task of keeping these clowns together quite feasible, especially the groom.
        <br>When reaching out to owner's for <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a>, DO NOT mention a bachelor's party.
        <br>Just substitute 'bachelor for 'birthday' party.(Try it yourself!)
        <br>
        <br>
    <div class="code">
        <p>def bachelor_party(answer):
    `   <p style="margin-left: 40px">answer == 'bachelor':</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">return "NO"</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">elif answer == 'birthday':</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">return "YES"</p>

        <h2> 2.Find Transportation</h2>
        <p>If I'm being honest I don't trust the driving skills of many of my friends. 
        <br> Also, what fun would a roadtrip be without everyone in the same car?.
        <br>If you haven't already guessed it, a giant passenger van for your traveling circus is the answer!

        <h2>3.Be Aware of your Surroundings</h2>
        <p>Check your luggage in your place of stay as soon as you can.
        <br>Don't run the risk of your party van getting broken into by envious locals.
        <br>If this occurs, don't fret. Your local Walmart can replace all of those fancy clothes.
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>At the end of the day it's all about the groom. Why not make the best of it and find some adult onesies, wear them, and continue shopping for your bare neccessities.</p>

        <h2>4. Eat and Drink All the Things</h2>
        <p>
        <br>Create an itinerary based from the most credible of reviews, your friend's on social media!
        <br>Go out and have a night on the town, you'll probably see some cool stuff like an Uber driver with no legs!

        <h2>5.Stay out of Trouble</h2>
        <p>The main goal of this trip is to have fun, but most importatly show the groom a good time.
        <br>Such a good time that he forgets that he made the decision to get married, just kidding!
        <br>What better way to stay out of trouble than to make the cops your friends!</p>
